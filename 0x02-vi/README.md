This project explores the basics of vi.

Vi is the default unix editor. In command mode every character typed is a command that does something to the text. In insert mode every character typed is inserted into the text. Type i for insert mode and hit <esc> to go back to command mode. To edit a file type vi <filename> and to quit type :q<return>. To quit and save to original file name :x<return>. :Bill Joy is the creator of vi and co-founder of Sun Microsystems.
