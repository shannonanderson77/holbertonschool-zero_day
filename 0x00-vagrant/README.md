A virtual machine is an emulation of a computer system. Vagrant is used to give an easy to configure, reproducible and portable work environment that allows for consistency in workflow and productivity. It works on top of a virtual machine as a wrapper allowing the user to easily create multiple virtual environments. Vagrant was initially a side project of Mitchell Hashimoto. It is open source software that is supported by Hashicorp, which was also created by Mitchell.
